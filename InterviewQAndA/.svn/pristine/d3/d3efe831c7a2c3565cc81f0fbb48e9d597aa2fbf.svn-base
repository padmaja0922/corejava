    1.  What is java?
        Java is a  secured, robust, multithreaded  , object oriented programming language used to develop
        java program.
    
    2.  What are the components used to develop java application?
        There are 5 components used to develop java application
           1. JDK
           2. IDE
           3. DB
           4. SVN
           5. APP/WEB SERVER
           
           JDK: used to develop java program
           IDE: sw application used to develop and debug java program - Eclipse , NetBeans, IntelJ
           DB: used to store data - MySql,Oracle
           SVN: environment used to store history of application - Svn, Git, Cvs
           SERVER: used to deploy the java web application.
           
     3.  What are the types applications can be created using java programming ?
         There are mainly 4 type of applications that can be created using java programming:
            1) Stand alone Application : It is also known as desktop application or window-based application. 
               An application that we need to install on every machine such as media player, antivirus etc.
               AWT and Swing are used in java for creating stand alone applications.
            2) Web Application : An application that runs on the server side and creates dynamic page,
               is called web application. Currently, servlet, jsp, struts, jsf etc. technologies are used for 
               creating web applications in java.
            3) Enterprise Application : An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications etc.
               It has the advantage of high level security, load balancing and clustering. In java, EJB is used for creating
               enterprise applications.
            4) Mobile Application : An application that is created for mobile devices. Currently Android and Java ME 
               are used for creating mobile applications.   
               
     4.   JVM memory model?
          JVM is an abstract machine. It's a specification which provides runtime environment in which java byte
          code is executed.
          Memory area alloted by JVM are:
            1. Class Area
            2. Heap Area
            3. Stack Area
            4. PC register
            5. Native Method Stack
            
            Class Area : is used to hold static data members.
            Heap Area: all the objects created during the program execution gets memory in heap.
                       The context of String are stored in special memory location called String Constant pool.
            Stack Area : stores frames, primitive local variables, partial results and plays part in method invocation
                         and returns.
            PC register: It contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.
            Native Method Stack : It contains all the native methods used in the application.             
                                    
            
     5. Naming Conventions of java?
         class name:	should start with upper case letter and be a noun e.g. String, Color, Button, Thread etc.
         interface name	should start with upper case letter and be an adjective e.g. Runnable, Remote, ActionListener etc.
         method name	should start with lower case letter and be a verb e.g. actionPerformed(), main(), print(), println() etc.
         variable name	should start with lower case letter e.g. firstName, orderNumber etc.
         package name	should be in lower case letter e.g. java, lang, sql, util etc.
         constants name	should be in upper case letter. e.g. RED, YELLOW, MAX_PRIORITY etc.
         
         
      6. Difference Between Heap and Stack?
      
         1.  When an object is created it always stored      1. Stack contains references to that object and local
               in heap                                             primitives data members
         2.  Heap memory is used by all parts of the         2. Stack is used by only one thread of execution.   
              application. 
      
         3.  Memory management in heap is done by            3. Memory management in stack is done in LIFO. 
              Garbage Collector.
         4.  Heap lives from start till the end of the       4. Stack is short lived. 
              application.
         5.  If heap is full java runtime throws             5. If stack is full java runtime throws
                java.lang.OutOfMemeory error.                      java.lang.StackOverFlow error.
         6.  We can use -Xms and -Xmx jvm option to          6. -Xss is used for stack.
                define the start and max size of heap 
     
     7. What is Class in java ?
          
           Class is template or blue print that represents state and behavior. In java state is represented as data 
           members and behavior is represented as methods.
           
     8. What is path and classpath?      
     
                        
            Path: Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
                  Path is nothing but setting up an environment for operating system. Operating System will look
                   in this PATH for executables.   Executables: javac.exe, java.exe, javadoc.exe, 
                   
            ClassPath: The CLASSPATH variable is one way to tell applications, including the JDK tools, 
                      where to look for user classes.Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java 
                      compiler to find the path, of classes.ie in J2EE we give the path of jar files. 
                      Classpath is nothing but setting up the environment for Java. Java will use to find compiled classes 
                      
     9.  Explain the  design in Java program?
            In java we design program using
              PackageName :(domain Name.companyName.projectName.functionality).
              Import: to import java util and lang class and other classes used in the applications.
              Class Declaration: (Access Modifier  class  ClassName).
              Properties : (Access Modifier   dataTypes   variableName).
              Method Declaration : (Access Modifier  returnType methodName()).

    10.  What are different OOPS concepts?
o            Abstraction - is a concept to hide implementation details by showing only essential features.
o            Polymorphism -  Polymorphism is the concept of an object’s ability to take on many forms.
o            Encapsulation - is a concept where restricting access of data members to class by making them private and providing 
                                 access outside class through getters and setters.
o            Inheritance -  is a concept where a sub class acquires properties and behaviour of  super class , then 
                                the classes are in IS-A relationship.
                                
                                
    11.  What is static in java ?
              Static is a keyword in java which can be applied towards 
                  variables , methods and blocks.
              when applied towards variables , they become class level variables. They gets memory in class area.
              when applied towards methods they can be accessed without creating object of that class.
              when applied towards blocks they are executed before constructors.
             
    12.  What is final in java?
               Final is a keyword in java which can be applied towards
                     variables, methods and classes
               when applied towards variables the values of it can't be changed.
               when applied towards methods they can't be overridden.
               when applied towards classes they can't be inherited.
               
    13.  What is Abstraction?
              Abstraction is one of the OOPs concept , it is the process of hiding implementation details and showing 
              only functionality. Abstraction deals with what object does rather than how it does. 
              At the time of designing the class Abstraction comes into comes into picture for further flexibility when 
              developer is not clear of the implementation details.
              In java method is declared with abstract keyword when there is no implementation of that method then
              class with abstract method becomes abstract. Extend keyword is used to extend the abstract class and implement
              the abstract methods.  It cannot be instantiated . 
             
    14.  What is Inheritance ?
              Inheritance is one of the OOPs concept , where a sub class acquires the properties and behavior of super class
              Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship, also known as parent-child relationship. In java Extends keyword 
              is used to  create sub class from super class.
              We use Inheritance in java for
                   For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
                   For Code Reusability.
                   
    15.  What is Polymorphism?
              Polymorphism is one of the OOPs concept  by which we can perform a single action by different ways. 
              There are two types of polymorphism in java: compile time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. 
              We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading (compile time polymorphism)
               and method overriding (runtime polymorphism). 
               
    16.  What is Encapsulation ?
                Encapsulation is one of the OOPs concept where we can restrict the access of data members by making them
                private and providing access outside the class by setters and getters.
                By providing only setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
                
    17.  What is method overloading and overriding?
                Overloading: If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in number of parameters or
                datatypes of parameters  it is known as  Method Overloading. If we have to perform only one operation,
                having same name of the methods increases the  readability of the program. 
                
                Overriding: In an Inheritance relationship if a subclass has the same method implementation which is 
                already declared in super class  it is known as method overriding in java. Methods signature must be same in 
                two classes. Method overriding is used achieve runtime polymorphism. 
               
     18.  What are different types of variables in Java?
            They are mainly 3 types of variables are declared in java
                1. Instance Variable : Variables declared in class but outside the method. By creating object of class we
                                       can access these variables.
                2. Static Variables : Instance variables declared with static keyword are called static variables. These
                                      variables are class level variables. They get memory in class area of jvm.
                3. Local Variables : Variables which are declared inside the method are known as local variables.
                                      The scope of these variables is within the method.
                                      
     20.   What is static and dynamic binding ?
               Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding.
               There are two types of binding
                    1. static binding (also known as early binding).
                    2. dynamic binding (also known as late binding).  
               Static Binding: When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as 
               static binding. If there is any private, final or static method in a class, there is static binding.                                                                                                       
               Dynamic Binding : When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding. 
               
     21.  What is an Interface ?.
               An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract method. It is used to
               achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. Java Interface also represents IS-A relationship.
               It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.
