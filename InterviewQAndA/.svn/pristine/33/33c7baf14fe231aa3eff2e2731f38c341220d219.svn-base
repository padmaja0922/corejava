    1.  What is java?
        Java is a  secured, robust, multithreaded  , object oriented programming language used to develop
        java program.
    
    2.  What are the components used to develop java application?
        There are 5 components used to develop java application
           1. JDK
           2. IDE
           3. DB
           4. SVN
           5. APP/WEB SERVER
           
           JDK: used to develop java program
           IDE: sw application used to develop and debug java program - Eclipse , NetBeans, IntelJ
           DB: used to store data - MySql,Oracle
           SVN: environment used to store history of application - Svn, Git, Cvs
           SERVER: used to deploy the java web application.
           
     3.  What are the types applications can be created using java programming ?
         There are mainly 4 type of applications that can be created using java programming:
            1) Stand alone Application : It is also known as desktop application or window-based application. 
               An application that we need to install on every machine such as media player, antivirus etc.
               AWT and Swing are used in java for creating stand alone applications.
            2) Web Application : An application that runs on the server side and creates dynamic page,
               is called web application. Currently, servlet, jsp, struts, jsf etc. technologies are used for 
               creating web applications in java.
            3) Enterprise Application : An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications etc.
               It has the advantage of high level security, load balancing and clustering. In java, EJB is used for creating
               enterprise applications.
            4) Mobile Application : An application that is created for mobile devices. Currently Android and Java ME 
               are used for creating mobile applications.   
               
     4.   JVM memory model?
          JVM is an abstract machine. It's a specification which provides runtime environment in which java byte
          code is executed.
          Memory area alloted by JVM are:
            1. Class Area
            2. Heap Area
            3. Stack Area
            4. PC register
            5. Native Method Stack
            
            Class Area : is used to hold static data members.
            Heap Area: all the objects created during the program execution gets memory in heap.
                       The context of String are stored in special memory location called String Constant pool.
            Stack Area : stores frames, primitive local variables, partial results and plays part in method invocation
                         and returns.
            PC register: It contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.
            Native Method Stack : It contains all the native methods used in the application.             
                                    
            
     5. Naming Conventions of java?
         class name:	should start with upper case letter and be a noun e.g. String, Color, Button, Thread etc.
         interface name	should start with upper case letter and be an adjective e.g. Runnable, Remote, ActionListener etc.
         method name	should start with lower case letter and be a verb e.g. actionPerformed(), main(), print(), println() etc.
         variable name	should start with lower case letter e.g. firstName, orderNumber etc.
         package name	should be in lower case letter e.g. java, lang, sql, util etc.
         constants name	should be in upper case letter. e.g. RED, YELLOW, MAX_PRIORITY etc.
         
         
      6. Difference Between Heap and Stack?
      
         1.  When an object is created it always stored      1. Stack contains references to that object and local
               in heap                                             primitives data members
         2.  Heap memory is used by all parts of the         2. Stack is used by only one thread of execution.   
              application. 
      
         3.  Memory management in heap is done by            3. Memory management in stack is done in LIFO. 
              Garbage Collector.
         4.  Heap lives from start till the end of the       4. Stack is short lived. 
              application.
         5.  If heap is full java runtime throws             5. If stack is full java runtime throws
                java.lang.OutOfMemeory error.                      java.lang.StackOverFlow error.
         6.  We can use -Xms and -Xmx jvm option to          6. -Xss is used for stack.
                define the start and max size of heap 
     
     7. What is Class in java ?
          
           Class is template or blue print that represents state and behavior. In java state is represented as data 
           members and behavior is represented as methods.
           
     8. What is path and classpath?      
     
                        
            Path: Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
                  Path is nothing but setting up an environment for operating system. Operating System will look
                   in this PATH for executables.   Executables: javac.exe, java.exe, javadoc.exe, 
                   
            ClassPath: The CLASSPATH variable is one way to tell applications, including the JDK tools, 
                      where to look for user classes.Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java 
                      compiler to find the path, of classes.ie in J2EE we give the path of jar files. 
                      Classpath is nothing but setting up the environment for Java. Java will use to find compiled classes 
                      
     9.  Explain the  design in Java program?
            In java we design program using
              PackageName :(domain Name.companyName.projectName.functionality).
              Import: to import java util and lang class and other classes used in the applications.
              Class Declaration: (Access Modifier  class  ClassName).
              Properties : (Access Modifier   dataTypes   variableName).
              Method Declaration : (Access Modifier  returnType methodName()).
              Comments 
              
    10.  What are different OOPS concepts?
o            Abstraction - is a concept to hide implementation details by showing only essential features.
o            Polymorphism -  Polymorphism is the concept of an object’s ability to take on many forms.
o            Encapsulation - is a concept where restricting access of data members to class by making them private and providing 
                                 access outside class through getters and setters.
o            Inheritance -  is a concept where a sub class acquires properties and behaviour of  super class , then 
                                the classes are in IS-A relationship.
                                
                                
    11.  What is static in java ?
              Static is a keyword in java which can be applied towards 
                  variables , methods and blocks.
              when applied towards variables , they become class level variables. They gets memory in class area.
              when applied towards methods they can be accessed without creating object of that class.
              when applied towards blocks they are executed before constructors.
             
    12.  What is final in java?
               Final is a keyword in java which can be applied towards
                     variables, methods and classes
               when applied towards variables the values of it can't be changed.
               when applied towards methods they can't be overridden.
               when applied towards classes they can't be inherited.
               
    13.  What is Abstraction?
              Abstraction is one of the OOPs concept , it is the process of hiding implementation details and showing 
              only functionality. Abstraction deals with what object does rather than how it does. 
              At the time of designing the class Abstraction comes into comes into picture for further flexibility 
              if the developer is not sure of the implementation details of the method.
              In java method is declared with abstract keyword when there is no implementation of that method then
              class with abstract method becomes abstract. Extend keyword is used to extend the abstract class and the class
              that implements the abstract class must implement the abstract methods.  It cannot be instantiated . 
             
    14.  What is Inheritance ?
              Inheritance is one of the OOPs concept , where a sub class acquires the properties and behavior of super class
              Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship, also known as parent-child relationship. In java Extends keyword 
              is used to  create sub class from super class.
              We use Inheritance in java for
                   For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
                   For Code Reusability.
                   
    15.  What is Polymorphism?
              Polymorphism is one of the OOPs concept  by which we can perform a single action by different ways. 
              There are two types of polymorphism in java: compile time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. 
              We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading (compile time polymorphism)
               and method overriding (runtime polymorphism). 
               
    16.  What is Encapsulation ?
                Encapsulation is one of the OOPs concept where we can restrict the access of data members by making them
                private and providing access outside the class by setters and getters.
                By providing only setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
                
    17.  What is method overloading and overriding?
                Overloading: If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in number of parameters or
                datatypes of parameters  it is known as  Method Overloading. If we have to perform only one operation,
                having same name of the methods increases the  readability of the program. 
                
                Overriding: In an Inheritance relationship if a subclass has the same method implementation which is 
                already declared in super class  it is known as method overriding in java. Methods signature must be same in 
                two classes. Method overriding is used achieve runtime polymorphism. 
               
     18.  What are different types of variables in Java?
            They are mainly 3 types of variables are declared in java
                1. Instance Variable : Variables declared in class but outside the method. By creating object of class we
                                       can access these variables.
                2. Static Variables : Instance variables declared with static keyword are called static variables. These
                                      variables are class level variables. They get memory in class area of jvm.
                3. Local Variables : Variables which are declared inside the method are known as local variables.
                                      The scope of these variables is within the method.
                                      
     20.   What is static and dynamic binding ?
               Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding.
               There are two types of binding
                    1. static binding (also known as early binding).
                    2. dynamic binding (also known as late binding).  
               Static Binding: When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as 
               static binding. If there is any private, final or static method in a class, there is static binding.                                                                                                       
               Dynamic Binding : When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding. 
               
     21.  What is an Interface ?.
               An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract method. It is used to
               achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. Java Interface also represents IS-A relationship.
               It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.  Interface represents a contract where class that implements
               the interface  has to  implement all the methods declared in the Interface. From java 1.8 we can have static
               and default methods in Interface.              
                                         
                
     22.   What are different types of access modifiers?
	            Public: Accessible everywhere.
	            Private: Accessible within the class.
	            Protected: Accessible within the package and outside the package only through inheritance.
	            Default: Accessible only within the package.
              
     23.   What is call by value?
                Passing a variable by value is that the value held in the variable that is passed as an argument is copied 
                into the parameters that are defined in the method header. That is why changes made to the variable within
                the method had no effect on the variable that was passed. when objects are passed, the object itself is
                passed. No copy is made. 

     24.   What is string pool?
	            String pool is a pool of strings stored in java heap memory.  String is possible only because of the 
	            immutability concept of the string. String pools help in saving lot of space for java Runtime. When we use 
	            double quotes to create a String, it first looks for String with same value in the String pool, if found it
	            just returns the reference else it creates a new String in the pool and then returns the reference.
	             
	             
    25.  Why string is immutable?
	            Majority of the data is represented in the form of strings. As a result, there are high chances of strings
	            pointing to the same reference. If a string changes, it will affect the other string which is being referenced 
	            to the same pointer and there are chances that it might become unreferenced which gets deleted by the automatic
	            garbage collector. This is the reason why strings are made immutable.
   
   26.  How do you make a class immutable?
                By declaring a class final.
                By declaring the properties of the class as final.
                By not providing the setters.
                
                
   27.  Difference between StringBuffer vs StringBuilder ?
   
            	StringBuffer	                                                     StringBuilder
            StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe.                    StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. 
            It means two threads can't call the methods of                 It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.
            simultaneously.          
                 
                 
                 
   28.  What is exception handling and how do you achieve it?
              Exception handling is a problem that occurs during the execution of the program. It disrupts the normal 
              flow of the program and the application terminates abnormally, which is not recommended so these exceptions
              are to be handled. It is achieved through try, catch and finally blocks.
              The code which can get exception is written in try block and if exception happens we catch it with catch block
              finally block contains statements which need to be executed if u handled exception or not.
              
   29.  What are checked vs unchecked exceptions?
              Checked exceptions are exceptions that occur at the compile time. The extend only the throwable class.
                  Example: File not found exception.
              Unchecked exceptions are exceptions that occur at the run time.
                  For example: - array out of bounds exception.
              
   30.   How does exception propagation works?
               An exception is first thrown from the top of the stack and if it is not caught, it drops down the call stack
               to the previous method, if not caught there, the exception again drops down to the previous method, and so on
               until they are caught or until they reach the very bottom of the call stack. This is called exception propagation.
               
               
   31.   Why strings are immutable in java?
             As most of the data is represented in the form of Strings, developers of java taught about reuseability without
             having to creating too many objects in memory. So string with same content point to same location in 
             string constant pool. If strings are mutable if we change content of one string it may effect other string
             properties pointing to that content, so strings are made immutable.    
             
             
  32.  How many ways u can create Strings?
           Strings can be created in 2 ways 
              1. using string literal ex: String s = "Text";
              2. using new keyword ex : String s = new String();
           When we create strings using string literal jvm first calls the intern() method to checks in string constant pool
           if the content is there, if it is there then it will return the address of that location , else it will create
           new object in string constant pool and returns that address.
           When we create Strings using new keyword first it creates object in the heap and checks for content in string
           constant pool, and object reference of the heap is returned.
           
           
  33.  JAVA Collection framework tree ?  
  
  34.  ArrayList vs LinkedList?
            ArrayList and LinkedList both implements List interface.
            ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements. Java LinkedList class uses node based doubly linked
            list to store the elements.
            ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis. Accessing in LinkedList is slow because
            it has to check each and every node until it finds the required element.
            ArrayList manipulation is hard because lot of shifting needs to be done .LinkedList class, manipulation is fast
            because no shifting needed.
            
  35.  List vs Set?
            List and all of its implementation classes maintains the insertion order. Set doesn’t maintain any order
            List allows duplicate elements. Set doesn't allow duplicate elements.
            List allows any number of null values. Set allows only one null value.   
            
  36.  Which one you prefer between ArrayList vs LinkedList ?
            If the functionality of your application requires  more insertion and deletion operations then use LinkedList
            else use ArrayList.
            
  37.  How do you sort collection of elements in JAVA ?
            Comparable and Comparator are interfaces used to sort collections.
            If you want to sort collections only on one property through out your functionality we can implement Comparable 
            Interface and implement its method compareTo. compareTo method takes one object as input and compares with this
            object of the class.
            If in your functionality requires  sorting on more than one property we implement Comparator Interface.
            It has compare method which takes 2 objects and compares them.
            
  38.   What is Collections class in JAVA ?
            Collections class contains static methods which we can use on collections. like sort, min, max etc.
            
  39.  HashTable vs HashMap ?
            HashMap and HashTable both implements Map interface, and holds values based on keys.
            HashMap is non synchronized. HashTable is synchronized.
            HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values. HashTable doesn't allow any null key or values.
                                                       
  40.  What is HashMap ? 
            In java HashMap is an unordered map which implements map interface and holds values based on keys. 
            It contains only unique elements. It can hold one null key and any number of null values.
            
  41.  How does HashMap Works?
            HashMap works on hashing techniques. It stores values based on keys. Each key-value pair is stored in an object 
            of Entry<K, V>class. The values of keys are stored in doubly LinkedList known as buckets.
            
            When  put() method is called:
               1. First checks whether the key is null or not. If the key is null, it calls putForNullKey() method. 
                  table[0] is always reserved for null key. Because, hash code of null is 0.
               2. If the key is not null, then it calculates the hash code of the key by calling hash() method.
               3. Then value of entry table is calculated. After calculating index it checks whether there is any bucket
                  present at that location if yes it runs equals method on keys. If equals method returns true then it replaces
                  value of that key. If false that is the case of HashMap collision in that case new bucket is created and added
                  to the existing bucket.
                   
            When  get() method is called :
                1. First checks whether specified key is null or not. If the key is null, it calls getForNullKey() method.
                2. If the key is not null, hash code of the specified key is calculated.
                3. Then index of entry table is calculated, after getting index it calls for equals method on key if its
                   true it returns the value.
                   
    42.  What is HashMap collision ?
             There are chances that the hashFunction returns same index for 2 different keys.  This is what we call a collision.
                              
             
    43.   What is ConcurrentHashMap ?
              
    44.   Why do you think Strings makes appropriate keys for HashMap ?
               As String are immutable having strings as keys there is a chance of getting same hash code each and everytime u run
               hash code function on strings so strings are prefered for keys.
               
                           
    45.  What kind of classes are good for HashMap keys ?
               Immutable classes.
               
    46.  What is Iterator vs ListIterator ?
              1. Iterator is used for traversing List and Set both. We can use ListIterator to traverse List only.
              2. We can traverse in only forward direction using Iterator.Using ListIterator, we can traverse a List
                 in both the directions (forward and Backward).                                       
              3. We cannot obtain indexes while using Iterator. We can obtain indexes at any point of time while traversing
                 a list using ListIterator.   
              4. We cannot add element to collection while traversing it using Iterator, it throws ConcurrentModificationException 
                 when you try to do it. We can add element at any point of time while traversing a list using ListIterator.
              
    47.  Comparable vs Comparator interfaces ?
              Comparable and Comparator are used for sorting collections. 
              1. Comparable provides single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of single element 
                   such as id or name or price etc.
                 Comparator provides multiple sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple 
                   elements such as id, name and price etc.  
              2. Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements. Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.     
              3. Comparable is found in java.lang package. Comparator is found in java.util package.
              4. In Comparable Collections.sort(List) method is used to sort list elements . In Comparator Collections.sort(List,Comparator) method
                   is used for sorting.
                   
    48.  TreeSet and TreeMap ?
              1. TreeSet implements Set interface and TreeMap implements Map interface.           
              2. TreeSet holds only one object where as TreeMap holds Key value pair. 
              3. TreeSet cann't have duplicate values but TreeMap can have duplicate values but unique keys.
              
    49.  What is contract between hash code and equals ?
               If two objects have same hash code then the equals method may or may not return true.
               If two objects are true for equals method then hash code for those objects must be same.
               If you overwrite one method you must overwrite another one.   
               
    50.  Why do you need override HashCode and equals?
