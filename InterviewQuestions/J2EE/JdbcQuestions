 
 1.  What is JDBC ?
        JDBC is an API that allows to connect to the database and populate the data to java objects 
		
 2.  What is the difference between a Statement and a PreparedStatement?
        Statement represents the base statements interface. In terms of efficiency, it is suitable to 
		use Statement only when we know that we will not need to execute the SQL query multiple times. 
		Statement doesnâ€™t offer support for the parameterized SQL queries, which is an important protection
		from SQL injection attacks. 
        Prepared Statement extends the Statement interface. In most cases it is more efficient 
		(in the context of multiple executions) to use the PreparedStatement because the SQL statement that 
		is sent gets pre-compiled (i.e. a query plan is prepared) in the DBMS. Furthermore, we can use
		PreparedStatement to safely provide values to the SQL parameters, through a range of setter methods 		
		
 3.  How do you call stored procedures in JDBC ?
        Using Callable Statement. 
		
 4.  How do you manage transactions in JDBC 
        Transaction represents a single unit of work.
        The ACID properties describes the transaction management well. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, isolation and durability.
        Atomicity : means either all successful or none.
        Consistency : ensures bringing the database from one consistent state to another consistent state.
        Isolation : ensures that transaction is isolated from other transaction.
        Durability : means once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of errors, power loss etc.
